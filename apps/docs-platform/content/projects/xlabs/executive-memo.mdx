# XLabs — Executive Memo

**One-line:** A project printer — recruits interns, equips them with AI agents and a lead, and ships MVPs in 4–6 weeks.

---

## The Thesis

Building software is commoditized. AI has collapsed the cost of writing code to near zero. The difference now is **velocity, packaging, and distribution**.

XLabs exploits this by running a factory model:

**1 Intern + 1 Lead + AI Agents + Distribution = MVP + Traction**

Each intern gets a project, a lead to guide them, a full suite of AI agents (PRD writer, deck generator, code orchestrator, outreach agent), and a distribution playbook. The output: a shipped product with real users in 4–6 weeks.

## How It Works

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Source | Week 0 | 20 candidates sourced, 5 selected |
| Onboard | Week 1 | Intern trained on stack, agents, and rituals |
| Build | Weeks 2–4 | MVP built and deployed to production |
| Ship | Week 5 | Landing page, GTM, first users |
| Scale | Week 6+ | Distribution engine, iterate on product |

## Part of Xventures

XLabs is the **build engine** of the Xventures ecosystem. It produces the projects that feed into Xventures' portfolio. Successful XLabs projects can be spun out, funded, or folded into existing Xventures ventures.

## The Model

| Input | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Interns | Hungry builders, pre-screened for velocity and taste |
| Lead | Experienced operator who guides 2–3 interns simultaneously |
| Agents | 8+ AI agents covering PRD, code, design, deck, outreach, SEO, content |
| Distribution | Templated GTM: landing page, outreach, content, SEO, paid |

| Output | Details |
|--------|---------|
| MVP | Deployed product with core features |
| Traction | First 50+ users, engagement data |
| Deck | Investor-ready pitch deck |
| Data Room | Complete project documentation |

---

## 90-Day Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Interns onboarded | 10 |
| MVPs shipped | 5+ |
| Projects generating revenue | 1+ |
| Agent stack operational | 8+ agents |
| Time from idea to MVP | Under 5 weeks |

## Why This Works

1. **AI collapses build cost** — an intern with agents can do what a 5-person team did 2 years ago
2. **Interns are underpriced talent** — high energy, low cost, willing to move fast
3. **Leads provide leverage** — one experienced person guides multiple projects
4. **Distribution is templated** — same playbook works across products
5. **Portfolio approach** — ship 10, one hits, the math works
