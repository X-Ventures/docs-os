## Why XLabs

Building is commoditized. Anyone with Cursor, Claude Code, and an API can produce code. The real differentiator is now **execution velocity**, **product packaging**, **distribution**, and **coaching quality**.

XLabs is a "project printer": we recruit talented interns, equip them with AI agents and a dedicated lead, and each intern ships a real product in 4-6 weeks.

## Non-Negotiable Principles

1. **Total ownership** — Each intern is the "founder" of their project
2. **Weekly cadence** — Every week has a demo, no week without a deploy
3. **Quality over Quantity** — One working MVP beats 3 abandoned projects
4. **Distribution from day 1** — Landing page and first channel from week 1
5. **Agents as multipliers** — Automate repetitive tasks
6. **Continuous measurement** — If we don't measure it, it doesn't exist
