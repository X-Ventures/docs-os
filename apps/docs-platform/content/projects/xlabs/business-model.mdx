# XLabs — Business Model

---

## Revenue Model

Each XLabs project is a potential revenue source. The model is a portfolio play — ship many, monetize the winners.

### Revenue Streams

| Stream | Description | Timeline |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| SaaS Products | Monthly subscriptions from shipped products | Q2+ |
| Marketplace Tools | One-time or subscription tools sold on marketplaces | Q2+ |
| Client Projects | Build-to-order MVPs for external clients | Q3+ |
| Licensing | License the XLabs system to other studios | Q4+ |

### Revenue Share

| Stakeholder | Share | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Xventures | 80–90% | Retains equity in all projects |
| Intern | 10–20% | Revenue share for first 12 months |

Interns receive revenue share (not equity) on projects they build. This aligns incentives without complicating the cap table.
