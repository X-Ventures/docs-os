# XLabs — Market Analysis

---

## The Macro Shift

AI has collapsed the cost of building software. What took a 5-person team 6 months now takes 1 person with AI agents 4–6 weeks. This creates a massive opportunity for a new type of venture studio that operates at 10x velocity.

## Thesis Summary

AI has created a window where the cost of building is near-zero, but the market hasn't adjusted yet. Most people still think they need a team, funding, and months of time to build a product. XLabs proves them wrong — and captures the value from the projects that emerge.
