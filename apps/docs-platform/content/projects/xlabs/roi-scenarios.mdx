# XLabs — ROI Model & Scenarios

**Status: To Build**

This section provides the scenario framework. Detailed modeling with validated assumptions is needed.

---

## Core Question

If XLabs ships 10 projects and 2 generate revenue, what is the expected return?

---

## Scenario Framework

### Assumptions

| Assumption | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Projects shipped per quarter | 5 |
| Cost per project | $18,500 |
| Quarterly investment | $92,500 |
| Revenue-generating success rate | 20% |
| Average time to first revenue | 3 months post-launch |

### Scenario Table

| Scenario | Projects Shipped | Revenue-Generating | Avg MRR per Winner | Quarterly Revenue | ROI |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----|
| Conservative | 5 | 1 (20%) | $5,000 | $15,000 | -84% |
| Base | 5 | 2 (40%) | $10,000 | $60,000 | -35% |
| Aggressive | 5 | 3 (60%) | $20,000 | $180,000 | +95% |
| Home Run | 5 | 2 (40%) + 1 breakout | $50,000 (breakout) | $210,000 | +127% |

## Annual Projections (Needed)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Total projects shipped | 10–20 | 20–40 |
| Revenue-generating projects | 2–4 | 5–10 |
| Total portfolio MRR | TBD | TBD |
| Total portfolio ARR | TBD | TBD |
| Cumulative investment | TBD | TBD |
| Cumulative return | TBD | TBD |

---

## Key Sensitivities to Model

| Variable | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Success rate (% revenue-generating) | Highest impact — difference between loss and profit |
| Average revenue per winning project | Determines magnitude of return |
| Time to revenue | Affects cash flow and payback period |
| Cohort size | Scales cost linearly, revenue non-linearly |
| Intern quality | Directly affects success rate and speed |

---

## Action Items

| Item | Priority |
|------|---------|
| Validate assumptions with first cohort data | P0 |
| Build detailed 12-month cash flow model | P1 |
| Model portfolio value (equity in shipped projects) | P1 |
| Compare ROI to alternative investments (direct hiring, outsourcing) | P2 |
