**Status: To Build**

---

## Current State

## Recommended Brand Direction

### Positioning

**"The factory that ships."**

XLabs is where ideas become products — fast. The brand should communicate speed, quality, and builder culture.

### Brand Attributes

| Attribute | Expression |
|-----------|-----------|
| Speed | "Weeks, not months." Everything communicates velocity. |
| Quality | Shipped means production-ready, not half-baked. |
| Builder Culture | Made by builders, for builders. No corporate polish. |
| AI-Native | Agents are first-class team members, not tools. |
| Ownership | Interns own their projects. This is their portfolio. |

### Tone of Voice

- **Direct** — say what you mean, no fluff
- **Confident** — we ship, we measure, we iterate
- **Inclusive** — anyone with hunger and velocity belongs here
- **Technical** — comfortable with code, agents, and systems thinking

### Visual Direction (Proposed)

| Element | Direction |
|---------|----------|
| Typography | Mono or geometric sans-serif (builder aesthetic) |
| Color | Dark mode primary, accent color TBD |
| Imagery | Screenshots of real products, terminal output, dashboards |
| Logo | Wordmark, minimal, no icon needed initially |
| Style | Modern, minimal, functional — more GitHub than Dribbble |
