# XLabs — Product Vision

For the detailed operating blueprint, see the [Operating Blueprint](/projects/xlabs/blueprint).

## What Is XLabs?

XLabs is a **project factory** — a repeatable system for turning ideas into shipped products at high velocity. It combines three ingredients that have never been available together:

1. **AI agents** that automate 80% of the build process
2. **Hungry interns** who provide energy, speed, and fresh perspective
3. **Experienced leads** who provide taste, judgment, and unblocking

The result: MVPs in 4–6 weeks instead of 4–6 months.

## The Pipeline

Every project follows the same 6-stage pipeline:

| Stage | What Happens | Key Agent |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Idea** | Problem identified, opportunity validated | Research Agent |
| **PRD** | Product requirements documented | PRD Agent |
| **Design** | UI/UX designed, user flows mapped | Design Agent |
| **Build** | Code written, tested, deployed | Orchestrator Agent |
| **Ship** | Landing page, GTM, first users | Outreach + SEO Agents |
| **Scale** | Iterate on feedback, grow distribution | Content + Analytics Agents |

## Agent Infrastructure

| Agent | Function | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Orchestrator | Coordinates all agents, manages pipeline | Priority build |
| PRD Agent | Generates product requirements from brief | Priority build |
| Deck Agent | Creates pitch decks from PRD | Priority build |
| Code Agent | Writes and reviews code | Leverage existing (Cursor, Copilot) |
| Design Agent | Generates UI mockups and components | Build in Q2 |
| Outreach Agent | Cold outreach, lead generation | Build in Q1 |
| SEO Agent | On-page SEO, content optimization | Build in Q1 |
| Content Agent | Blog posts, social content, documentation | Build in Q2 |

---

## What Success Looks Like (90 Days)

- 10 interns running through the pipeline
- 5+ MVPs deployed to production
- 1+ project generating real revenue
- Agent stack fully operational (8+ agents)
- Repeatable playbook documented and tested
- Time from idea to deployed MVP consistently under 5 weeks

---

## Long-Term Vision

XLabs becomes the **default way to build** at Xventures. Every new project starts in XLabs. The factory gets faster and smarter with each iteration — agents learn from past projects, playbooks refine, and the best interns become leads.

Eventually, XLabs itself becomes a product: other venture studios and accelerators license the system.
