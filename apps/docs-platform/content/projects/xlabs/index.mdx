## Executive Summary

XLabs is a "project printer" within the Xventures ecosystem. We recruit talented interns, equip them with AI agents and a dedicated lead, and each intern ships a real product in 4-6 weeks — from build to distribution.

**Thesis**: Building is commoditized. The differentiator is execution velocity, product packaging, distribution, and coaching quality.
