# XLabs — Pitch Deck

**Status: To Build**

---

## Slide Outline

### Slide 1 — The Problem

**Building is commoditized. Execution is all that matters.**

AI has collapsed the cost of writing code to near zero. But most teams still operate like it's 2020 — slow, expensive, over-planned. The bottleneck is no longer building. It's shipping.

### Slide 2 — XLabs Model

**A project factory that ships MVPs in 4–6 weeks.**

1 intern + 1 lead + AI agents + distribution playbook = shipped product with real users.

### Slide 3 — How It Works (Pipeline)

| Stage | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Source and Select | Week 0 | 5 interns from 20 candidates |
| Onboard | Week 1 | Trained on stack, agents, rituals |
| Build | Weeks 2–4 | MVP deployed to production |
| Ship | Week 5 | Landing page, GTM, first users |
| Scale | Week 6+ | Distribution engine, iterate |

### Slide 4 — Agent Infrastructure

8+ AI agents that automate 80% of the build process:

- Orchestrator, PRD Agent, Deck Agent (core)
- Outreach Agent, SEO Agent, Content Agent (distribution)
- Code Agent, Design Agent (build)

### Slide 5 — Track Record

- Projects shipped to date
- Intern success stories
- Revenue generated
- Key metrics and milestones

### Slide 6 — Team

- Xventures leadership team
- Key leads and operators
- Advisory relationships

### Slide 7 — The Ask
