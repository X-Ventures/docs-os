# XLabs — Financial Model

**Status: To Build**

This section provides the initial framework. A detailed financial model with projections, assumptions, and sensitivity analysis is needed.

---

## Initial Framework

### Cost Per Intern Cohort

| Item | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Intern stipends (5 interns) | $7,500 | $1,500/intern/month |
| Lead salary (1 lead) | $8,000 | Fractional or part-time |
| AI infrastructure (APIs, hosting) | $2,000 | OpenAI, Anthropic, hosting |
| Tooling (Cursor, Figma, etc.) | $500 | Per-seat licenses |
| Deployment (Vercel, AWS) | $500 | Production hosting |
| **Total** | **$18,500/mo** | Per 5-intern cohort |

### Cost Per MVP

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average time to MVP | 4–6 weeks |
| Cost per MVP (1 month) | $18,500 |
| Cost per MVP (6 weeks) | $27,750 |

## Expected Revenue Per Shipped Project

| Scenario | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Non-revenue (portfolio value only) | $0 | $0 |
| Early traction (freemium) | $500–$2,000 | $6K–$24K |
| Revenue-generating | $5,000–$20,000 | $60K–$240K |
| Breakout success | $50,000+ | $600K+ |

---

## Break-Even Analysis (Needed)

Key questions to answer:

- How many projects need to generate revenue to cover cohort costs?
- What's the minimum MRR threshold per project for Xventures to profit?
- What's the payback period on a single cohort investment?
- How does the model scale with 2, 3, or 5 simultaneous cohorts?

## Action Items

| Item | Priority |
|------|---------|
| Build full P&L model (12-month projection) | P0 |
| Model cost sensitivity (intern count, lead cost, infra) | P1 |
| Model revenue scenarios by project success rate | P1 |
| Calculate break-even at various cohort sizes | P1 |
| Compare unit economics to traditional dev agency and venture studio | P2 |
