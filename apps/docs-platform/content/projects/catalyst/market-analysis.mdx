## Market Context

Web3 venture capital deployed over **$30B annually** at peak (2021-2022), settling to $10-15B in 2025-2026. The tools used to manage this capital flow are fragmented: email, Telegram, DocSend, spreadsheets, and manual research. No single platform provides an integrated intelligence layer.
