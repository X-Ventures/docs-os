# Catalyst — Brand Strategy

---

## Positioning

**"The Bloomberg Terminal for Web3 Venture Capital."**

Catalyst is not a social platform. Not a marketplace. Not a CRM. It is an **intelligence platform** that gives VCs and founders an unfair information advantage in Web3 deal flow.

---

## Target Segments

| Segment | Profile | Pain Point | Catalyst Value |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Web3 VCs** (Primary) | Crypto-native funds, 2-10 person teams | Drowning in random decks, missing good deals | AI-scored, filtered deal flow on autopilot |
| **Web3 Founders** (Primary) | Seed/Pre-seed, raising $500K-5M | Cold outreach is broken, no feedback on deck | PitchScan analysis + direct investor access |
| **Angel Investors** | Individual investors, crypto-rich | No systematic deal sourcing | Curated pipeline with quality filter |
| **Accelerators** (Secondary) | Web3 programs | Manual batch evaluation | PitchScan API for batch analysis |

---

## Brand Voice

| Attribute | Direction |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Tone** | Professional, data-driven, efficient |
| **Personality** | The sharp analyst, not the friendly assistant |
| **Language** | Direct, metrics-first, no fluff |
| **Visual** | Dark theme, data-heavy dashboards, terminal aesthetic |
