## Slide Outline (10 Slides)

| Slide | Title | Content |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | **The Problem** | VC deal flow is broken. Investors drown in 100+ decks/week via email, Telegram, DocSend. Founders send 200 cold emails, get 2 calls, 0 checks. No intelligence layer. |
| 2 | **The Solution** | Catalyst: the deal flow OS for Web3 venture. AI-powered analysis, curated pipeline, automated intelligence. |
| 3 | **Product** | PitchScan (10 VC personas, consensus score, deep reasoning), Investor Database (6,500+), CRM, Competitive Intelligence (Surf AI), 6 automated agents. |
| 4 | **How It Works** | Founder uploads deck, PitchScan analyzes in 10 seconds, deal enters curated pipeline, investor discovers and connects. |
| 5 | **Market** | $37B TAM (VC tech + Web3). 2,000+ crypto funds, 5,000+ startups raising annually. Comparable exits: PitchBook ($4.5B), Crunchbase ($1B+), DocSend ($165M). |
| 6 | **Business Model** | Freemium SaaS: Founder $0-99/mo, Investor $0-1,000/mo. Plus promoted placements, success fees (1-2%), data products, white-label. |
| 7 | **Traction** | Live at catalyst3.xyz. 6,500+ VC database. 6 automated agents. 13/14 E2E tests passing. 373ms avg API response. Beta phase. |
| 8 | **Competition** | Only platform with AI analysis + deal flow + intelligence + Web3. PitchBook is $30K/yr, no AI. AngelList not Web3. Messari is data only. |
| 9 | **Team** | Xventures ecosystem. Engineering, product, VC network. |
| 10 | **The Ask** | Raising $X for: engineering (scale infra), growth (500 paid users), partnerships (5 integrations), content (thought leadership). |
