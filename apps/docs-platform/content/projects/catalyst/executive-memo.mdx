# Catalyst — Executive Memo

> Internal | February 2026

---

## Thesis

VC deal flow is broken. Investors drown in random pitch decks via email, Telegram, and DocSend. Founders send 200 cold emails, get 10 replies, 2 calls, 0 checks. Both sides waste enormous time with no intelligence layer.

Catalyst fixes this by creating an **AI-powered deal flow operating system** that serves both sides of the market simultaneously.

## Recommendation

Catalyst is **production-ready at 80%** (per engineering audit). The core PitchScan AI and Deep Research features deliver genuine value. Priority fixes needed: background job architecture for scanning (P0, 2-3 days), input validation (P0, 1 day), AI categorization improvement (P1, 1 week).

**Next milestone**: Convert beta users to paid subscribers, reach $5K MRR within 90 days.
