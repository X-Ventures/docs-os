## The Smartphone Parallel

| Era | What Happened | AlterEgo Parallel |
|-----|--------------|-------------------|
| Pre-iPhone (2000-2006) | Feature phones dominated. "No one needs a computer in their pocket." | Everyone uses AI through their phone. It works. It's fine. |
| iPhone Moment (2007) | Apple didn't make a better phone — they created a category. $499 in a $0-with-contract market. | AlterEgo: AI deserves its own device. One that knows you and doesn't fight for your attention. |
| Post-iPhone (2008-2015) | $0 to $500B market in under a decade. Ecosystem > hardware. | "Personal AI device" becomes a category. AlterEgo defines it. |

**The iPhone didn't win because it was the best phone. It won because it was the best computer. AlterEgo won't win because it's the best AI app. It will win because it's the best AI relationship.**

## Why Now — Five Forces Converging

| Force | Evidence |
|-------|---------|
| **Model Capability Inflection** | GPT-4, Claude 3.5 crossed "useful enough for daily life." On-device inference viable. Cost dropping 10x per 18 months. |
| **Consumer AI Literacy** | 72% of US adults have tried generative AI. The "explain what AI is" burden is lifted. |
| **Privacy Regulation Wave** | EU AI Act, GDPR escalating, 12+ US state laws. Privacy-first is a market requirement, not a feature. |
| **Hardware Convergence** | Powerful edge AI chips sub-$50, quality small displays are commodity, manufacturing feasible at $599 with healthy margins. |
| **Competitive Vacuum** | Rabbit R1 and Humane proved demand. Both stumbled. Big tech focused on incremental. OpenAI hardware is pre-product. Window is open. |
