# AlterEgo

> The first computer that knows you.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Stage** | Pre-Seed / Seed |
| **Sector** | Consumer Hardware + AI |
| **Raise** | $5M Seed |
| **Hardware ASP** | $599–$799 |
| **Year 1 Target** | 250,000 units / $150M revenue |
| **Subscription** | $14.99/mo (AlterEgo+) |

## TL;DR (2-Minute Overview)

AlterEgo is a **dedicated AI agent in a premium home device** — a beautifully crafted orb with a circular OLED display, personalized avatar, and private AI that learns who you are over time. Unlike phone-based assistants (Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT), AlterEgo is not distracted by notifications, doesn't sell your data, and builds a cumulative understanding of your life.

**Business model**: Hardware ($599–$799, ~55% gross margin) + Subscription ($14.99–$29/mo) + Skill marketplace (70/30 rev share). Transitions from hardware-dominant to platform-dominant by Year 5.

**Market**: $800B+ TAM at intersection of consumer electronics, AI software, and smart home. $120B SAM. AlterEgo occupies the only unoccupied quadrant: **high personalization + high privacy**.

**Competitive edge**: 5,000+ OpenClaw skills at launch (equivalent of launching iPhone with 5,000 apps), cumulative personalization lock-in, Apple-level brand positioning, privacy-first architecture.

## Key Risk Summary

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Hardware execution (manufacturing at scale) | High | $750K allocated in seed for first 50K units + tooling |
| Consumer adoption slower than projected | Medium | Privacy narrative + ecosystem of 5,000+ skills de-risks utility |
| Competition from OpenAI + Jony Ive device | Medium | 12-18 month first-mover window; privacy moat they can't claim |
| Subscription churn higher than modeled | Low | Personalization deepens over time (switching cost increases monthly) |
