# AlterEgo — Brand Strategy

> Confidential | February 2026 | Auto-synced from Google Drive

## The Brand

AlterEgo is **not a technology brand. It is a human brand.** Every brand decision must pass one test: *Does this make someone feel something?* If the answer is no, it doesn't ship.

---

## Positioning Statement

For design-conscious consumers who are ready for AI that's personal and private, AlterEgo is a dedicated AI agent in a premium home device that learns who you are and works only for you. Unlike phone-based assistants, AlterEgo gives you a deeply personal, private AI experience without the distractions, data harvesting, or compromises.

---

## Messaging Framework

| Tier | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Tier 1: Headlines** | Emotional hook. Short, evocative. Billboards, keynotes. | "The first computer that knows you." / "AI that stays." / "Your mind. Amplified." |
| **Tier 2: Subheads** | Value prop. One sentence. Product pages, ads. | "A personal AI agent that learns your world, protects your privacy, and lives in your home." |
| **Tier 3: Proof Points** | Concrete specifics. 2-3 sentences. Detail pages, reviews. | "AlterEgo uses private AI models — your conversations are never used for training or ads. Data stays on your device or encrypted cloud. Period." |

---

## Brand Voice

**Tone**: Warm, confident, understated. Like a trusted friend who is remarkably thoughtful.

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Speak in human language: "It remembers your morning routine" | Use jargon: LLM, NLP, edge computing, neural network |
| Be specific: "Tells you about traffic before your Thursday run" | Use empty superlatives: "revolutionary," "groundbreaking" |
| Be confident without arrogance | Be cute or quirky — warm but not whimsical |
| Embrace silence. Let the product speak. | Reference competitors by name in advertising |

---

## Visual Identity

| Element | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| **Design Language** | Clean, minimal, white-space dominant. Product always in context (shelf, desk, kitchen). |
| **Typography** | Clean modern sans-serif (SF Pro Display or geometric grotesque). Light to Medium weight. Generous letter spacing. |
| **Primary Colors** | Warm white (#FAFAFA), Deep black (#0A0A0A) |
| **Secondary Colors** | Soft silver (#C0C0C0), Warm gold (#C8A87C) |
| **Photography** | Warm tones, natural light, muted backgrounds. Real home environments. |
| **Packaging** | Apple-inspired unboxing. White exterior, embossed wordmark, magnetic lid, device on pedestal. No plastic. |

## Launch Strategy

| Phase | Timeline | Objective | Key Actions |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Mystique** | 3 months pre-launch | Create desire before anyone can buy | Cryptic billboards in 5 cities (SF, NYC, London, Tokyo, Berlin). Waitlist goal: 500,000. |
| **Reveal** | Launch Day | Create a category-defining event | Keynote, 500 seats invite-only, livestreamed. Pre-orders open immediately, ship within 2 weeks. |
| **Momentum** | Months 1-6 post-launch | Turn early adopters into evangelists | User story campaign (short films in real homes), referral program, pop-ups in 10 cities. |
| **Expansion** | Months 6-12 | Broaden market, maintain premium | Holiday campaign "The gift that knows them", international (UK, DE, JP, KR, AU), 50 retail locations. |

**Influencer Strategy**: 200 units seeded 4 weeks before launch. NOT tech reviewers first — lifestyle influencers, designers, writers, parents. Brief: "Live with it for two weeks. Then share what happened."

## Early Adopter Profile

| Segment | Demographics | Psychographics | Motivation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **"The Intentional Consumer"** (Primary) | 28-45, $100K+ HHI, urban/suburban | Design-conscious, privacy-aware, tech-forward not tech-obsessed, quality over quantity | "Finally AI that doesn't feel creepy" / "I want AI without more phone time" |
| **"The Modern Family"** (Secondary) | 32-50, $120K+ HHI, 1-3 children, suburban | Overwhelmed by coordination, worried about kids' privacy | "It helps us spend less time managing life and more time living it" |

## Campaign: "Know You"

Three short films showing AlterEgo in daily life — emotional moments, not feature demos:

| Film | Concept | Emotional Core |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Morning** | Woman walks into kitchen half-awake. AlterEgo briefs her softly. She never picks up her phone. | Calm, relief |
| **Remember** | Elderly man asks AlterEgo about Saturday. It recounts his granddaughter's visit — details he'd started to forget. | Tenderness, memory |
| **Private** | Woman asks something deeply personal. We never hear the question. We see her relief at the answer. | Trust, safety |

Each ends with: *"AlterEgo. The first computer that knows you."*
