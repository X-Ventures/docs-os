# AlterEgo — Business Model

> Confidential | February 2026 | Auto-synced from Google Drive

## The Model

Hardware-plus-subscription, inspired by Apple (hardware premium + services), Peloton (device + subscription), and Tesla (hardware + software recurring). Strong hardware margins at launch, compounding subscription revenue becomes the dominant profit driver by Year 3.

## Strategic Moats

| Moat | Why It Compounds |
|------|-----------------|
| **Personalization Lock-in** | Every day of use increases switching costs. By Year 2, 18 months of irreplaceable context. |
| **Platform Network Effects** | More users → more developers → more skills → more users. Flywheel begins Year 2. |
| **Brand Premium** | Apple-level positioning allows premium pricing and loyalty that survives competitive pressure. |
| **Privacy Trust** | Trust earned slowly, lost instantly. Proven track record becomes unreplicable asset. |
| **Data Efficiency** | Private models fine-tuned for personal use get more efficient over time, reducing costs while improving experience. |
