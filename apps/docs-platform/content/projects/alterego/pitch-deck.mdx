## Slide-by-Slide Outline

### Slide 1 — The Problem

**AI is trapped in your phone.**

Today's AI assistants are afterthoughts — bolted onto devices designed for other purposes. They share your attention with notifications, apps, and distractions. They don't know you deeply because they can't observe your life. And the ones that try (Alexa, Google Home) send everything to the cloud, trading your privacy for convenience.

There is no AI that is truly *yours*.

### Slide 2 — The Solution

**AlterEgo: Your dedicated AI agent.**

A beautiful, premium home device with a single purpose — to be the most helpful AI in your life. Always on, always listening (on-device only), always learning about you. No cloud dependency for core functions. No data sold. No ads.

### Slide 3 — Product Demo

Live demonstration of core experiences:
- Morning briefing personalized to your schedule, interests, and habits
- Hands-free cooking assistant with real-time voice interaction
- Smart home orchestration across 200+ device integrations
- OpenClaw skill marketplace walkthrough

### Slide 4 — Market Opportunity

| Segment | Size |
|---------|------|
| TAM (Global Smart Home + AI Assistant) | $156B by 2028 |
| SAM (Premium Smart Home, US/EU) | $23B |
| SOM (Year 3, Addressable) | $2.1B |

The market is massive and growing 25%+ annually. Privacy-conscious consumers are the fastest-growing segment.

### Slide 5 — Business Model

Five revenue streams creating a diversified, defensible business:

1. **Hardware** — Premium device ($599–$799)
2. **Subscription** — Monthly AI service ($9.99–$19.99/mo)
3. **Marketplace** — 30% take on OpenClaw skill sales
4. **Enterprise** — B2B licensing of the platform
5. **Data Insights** — Anonymized, opt-in aggregate intelligence

### Slide 6 — Traction / Waitlist

- Waitlist signups and growth trajectory
- Press coverage and media mentions
- Developer interest in OpenClaw platform
- Strategic partnership LOIs
- Social media engagement metrics

### Slide 7 — Competition Matrix

**2x2 Positioning Map:**

|  | Low Privacy | High Privacy |
|--|------------|-------------|
| **High Personalization** | *(empty — AlterEgo wins here)* | **AlterEgo** |
| **Low Personalization** | Alexa, Google Home, Siri | HomePod (limited AI) |

AlterEgo is the only product in the high-personalization + high-privacy quadrant.

### Slide 8 — Team
