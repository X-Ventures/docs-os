# AlterEgo — Executive Memo

**One-line:** A dedicated AI agent that lives in a premium home device — always on, deeply personal, radically private.

---

## The Opportunity

AI assistants today are trapped inside phones and laptops — shared, shallow, and privacy-compromised. AlterEgo is a purpose-built AI companion in a premium hardware form factor ($599–$799), paired with a subscription service for continuous intelligence.

AlterEgo occupies the only open quadrant in the market: **high personalization + high privacy**. No other product combines a dedicated device, on-device processing, and deep personal context.

## Product

- **Hardware:** Premium home device ($599–$799 ASP) with custom silicon for on-device AI inference
- **Software:** OpenClaw OS — an open, extensible agent operating system
- **Ecosystem:** 5,000+ OpenClaw skills at launch via marketplace
- **Personalization:** Learns your preferences, routines, and context over time
- **Privacy:** On-device processing, no cloud dependency for core functions

## Why Now

1. On-device AI inference is finally powerful enough (edge compute breakthrough)
2. Consumer trust in big tech AI is declining (privacy tailwind)
3. Smart home penetration at 45%+ in target demographics
4. OpenClaw ecosystem creates network effects from day one
