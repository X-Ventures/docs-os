## Action Items to Reach Full Completeness

| Priority | Missing Item | Effort | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High | Team / Ops Plan | Medium | Operations | Define validator operator role, on-call rotation, escalation paths. Critical for Go/No-Go. |
| High | Legal / Compliance | High | Legal | EU MiCA implications, staking as a service classification, tax treatment of TAO emissions. Engage crypto-specialized counsel. |
| Medium | 90-Day OKRs | Low | Strategy | Extend 30-day OKRs to cover Phase 2 (transition) and Phase 3 (scale). Depends on 30-day results. |
| Low | Infrastructure Spec | Medium | Infra | Detailed architecture diagram, network topology, GPU provisioning plan, disaster recovery. Partially covered in Executive Memo. |
