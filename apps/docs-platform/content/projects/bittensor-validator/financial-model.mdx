## Break-Even Analysis

### Operational Break-Even (Yield Covers OPEX)

| Strategy | Annual OPEX | Required Annual Yield | Required Stake (TAO) | Required Stake (EUR) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Strategy A — Weight Copying | €25,200 | €25,200 at 4.5% APY | ~3,500 TAO | ~€630,000 |
| Strategy B — Real Validation | €57,600 | €57,600 at 5.5% APY | ~10,500 TAO | ~€1,890,000 |
| Strategy C — Hybrid | €38,400 | €38,400 at 5.0% APY | ~7,100 TAO | ~€1,278,000 |

### Total Break-Even (Including Capital)

For total P&L break-even (operational + capital), the required TAO price appreciation depends on stake size:

| Stake Size | Required TAO Appreciation (Strat C) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1,500 TAO | +9.1% (to ~$212) | Just to offset operational losses |
| 3,500 TAO | +0% | Operational break-even at 0% appreciation |
| 5,000 TAO | -1.8% | Operationally profitable, small price drop tolerated |
| 10,000 TAO | -5.2% | Comfortable margin even with modest decline |

## Sensitivity Analysis

### What If TAO Price Changes?

Assumes Strategy C, 5,000 TAO, 12-month horizon, 5.0% APY:

| TAO Price (12mo) | Change | Capital Gain/Loss | Operational P&L | Total P&L | Total ROI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $97.27 | -50% | -€450,000 | -€9,200 | -€459,200 | -50.1% |
| $136.18 | -30% | -€270,000 | -€2,600 | -€272,600 | -29.7% |
| $155.63 | -20% | -€180,000 | +€1,100 | -€178,900 | -19.5% |
| $175.09 | -10% | -€90,000 | +€4,800 | -€85,200 | -9.3% |
| $194.54 | 0% | €0 | +€8,200 | +€8,200 | +0.9% |
| $233.45 | +20% | +€180,000 | +€12,800 | +€192,800 | +21.0% |
| $291.81 | +50% | +€450,000 | +€18,600 | +€468,600 | +51.1% |
| $389.08 | +100% | +€900,000 | +€28,800 | +€928,800 | +101.3% |

### What If APY Changes?

Assumes Strategy C, 5,000 TAO, 12-month horizon, TAO flat:

| APY | Annual Yield (EUR) | Annual OPEX | Operational P&L | Margin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.0% | €17,900 | €38,400 | -€20,500 | -54% |
| 3.0% | €26,850 | €38,400 | -€11,550 | -30% |
| 4.0% | €35,800 | €38,400 | -€2,600 | -7% |
| 5.0% | €44,750 | €38,400 | +€6,350 | +17% |
| 6.0% | €53,700 | €38,400 | +€15,300 | +40% |
| 7.0% | €62,650 | €38,400 | +€24,250 | +63% |
| 8.0% | €71,600 | €38,400 | +€33,200 | +86% |

### Key Takeaway

The model is **dominated by TAO price movement**. A 10% TAO price swing has more impact than a 2% APY change. At 5,000 TAO:

- A 1% TAO price change = ~€9,000 impact
- A 1% APY change = ~€8,950/year impact

This means **position sizing and price conviction matter more than yield optimization**.
