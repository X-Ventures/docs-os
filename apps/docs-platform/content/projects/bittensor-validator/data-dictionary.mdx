## Metrics Dictionary

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **TAO** | The native token of the Bittensor network. Used for staking, validator registration, and miner incentives. Hard cap of 21,000,000 TAO (Bitcoin-like issuance curve). |
| **Subnet** | A specialized sub-network within Bittensor focused on a specific AI/ML task (e.g., text generation, image generation, data scraping). Each subnet has its own miners and validators. Currently 128 active subnets. |
| **Alpha** | The subnet-specific token earned by validators and miners on a given subnet. Alpha accrues based on performance and is convertible to TAO. |
| **alpha_out** | The rate at which Alpha tokens are emitted from a subnet to its participants. Higher alpha_out means more rewards flowing from that subnet. |
| **Emission %** | The percentage of total network TAO emissions allocated to a specific subnet. Determined by root network validators' weight-setting. Higher emission % = more TAO rewards for that subnet's participants. |
| **Root Proportion** | The share of a validator's stake allocated to the root network (Subnet 0). Root validators set weights on subnets to determine emission allocation. |
| **ADR (Annual Dilution Rate)** | The rate at which new TAO enters circulation through emissions. Relevant for understanding long-term supply dynamics and inflation pressure. |
| **VTrust** | A score (0 to 1) measuring how aligned a validator's weights are with the consensus of other validators. Higher VTrust = more emissions. Weight copiers typically have VTrust slightly below top validators. Target: ≥0.85. |
| **Dividend Score** | A composite score reflecting a validator's earnings performance across subnets. Combines stake weight, VTrust, and subnet emissions to determine actual TAO received. |
| **Take** | The percentage (0-18%) of delegated stake rewards that a validator keeps as a fee. A validator with 10% take keeps 10% of rewards generated by delegated stake. Higher take = more revenue but less attractive to delegators. |
| **Stake (Root)** | TAO staked directly on the root network (Subnet 0). Required for validators to participate in emission allocation voting. |
| **Stake (Alpha)** | TAO staked on individual subnets, represented as Alpha tokens. Determines the validator's weight and reward share on that specific subnet. |
| **Stake (Total)** | The sum of all staked TAO across root and all subnets. Total stake determines a validator's overall network influence and earning potential. |
| **Weight Copying** | The practice of copying weight vectors from a high-performing validator instead of running real evaluation tasks. Lower cost but produces slightly lower VTrust and is vulnerable to Commit Reveal. |
| **Commit Reveal** | A protocol mechanism that subnet owners can enable to prevent weight copying. When active, validators must commit their weights in an encrypted form before revealing them, making it impossible to copy in real-time. |
| **Tempo** | The block interval at which a subnet processes weight updates and distributes rewards. Each subnet has its own tempo. Faster tempo = more frequent reward cycles. |
| **Incentive Burn** | TAO burned during subnet registration and certain network operations. Reduces circulating supply and acts as a deflationary mechanism. |
| **APY (Annual Percentage Yield)** | The annualized return on staked TAO from emissions alone (excludes price appreciation). Varies by validator performance, subnet selection, and total network stake. Current range: 3-8% for active validators. |
| **Yuma Consensus** | Bittensor's consensus mechanism that determines how rewards are distributed. Validators' weights are aggregated using a reputation-weighted algorithm. Validators who align with consensus earn more (higher VTrust). |
| **Child Hotkey** | A delegation mechanism where a validator can assign a "child" hotkey to operate on specific subnets while the parent hotkey manages the overall validator. Enables operational separation of duties. |
| **Coldkey** | The offline/cold storage key that controls a validator's staked TAO. Used for high-security operations like unstaking or transferring TAO. Should be stored on a hardware wallet or air-gapped machine. |
| **Hotkey** | The online key used for day-to-day validator operations (setting weights, registering on subnets). Compromise of a hotkey does not directly risk staked funds (controlled by coldkey). |

## Limitations

### Data Freshness

- TAO price and network metrics are point-in-time snapshots. The crypto market moves 24/7. All financial projections should be re-validated before any capital deployment decision.
- Subnet emissions and rankings change frequently as new subnets launch and existing ones gain or lose traction.

### APY Estimates

- APY figures are estimates based on current emission rates and stake distribution. Actual APY will vary based on: total network stake growth, subnet emission changes, validator performance, and protocol upgrades.
- Historical APY data for Bittensor validators is limited (under 2 years of meaningful data).

### Commit Reveal Timeline

- The activation timeline for Commit Reveal on individual subnets is unpredictable. Subnet owners can enable it at any time. Our model assumes it is **not** active during the pilot period, but this is a key risk.

### Model Assumptions

- The financial model assumes constant OPEX and linear yield accumulation. In practice, OPEX will vary (especially GPU costs) and yield is non-linear due to VTrust dynamics and subnet changes.
- EUR/USD exchange rate is assumed constant. Currency risk is not modeled separately.

### Survivorship Bias

- Current top subnets may not remain top performers. The model focuses on today's highest-emission subnets, but the subnet landscape is highly dynamic.
